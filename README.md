# üõ°Ô∏è Safe Space Web Filter Proxy

A simple educational web filtering proxy built in Python.  
It can **block specific domains or keywords** in HTTP/HTTPS traffic and show a custom HTML message ‚Äî  
> ‚ÄúGo do some work, you lazybones!‚Äù

---

## üöÄ Features
- Works as a local **HTTP/HTTPS proxy**
- **Blocklist mode:** blocks only the listed domains or keywords  
- Shows a custom **403 HTML page** for blocked sites
- Logs all decisions in `decisions.log`
- `/status` endpoint with JSON stats
- Supports **HTTPS tunneling (CONNECT)** and MITM for blocked hosts

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
 
   pip install pyopenssl certifi
Run the proxy

python3 web_filter_proxy.py
You‚Äôll see:

Web filter listening on 0.0.0.0:8888
[MODE] Blocklist mode, default_policy=allow
[ADMIN] Status available at http://127.0.0.1:8890/status
Configure your browser to use the proxy

HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1

Port: 8888

Also use it for HTTPS

Import and trust the certificate

File: ca.cert.pem

Add it to your browser‚Äôs trusted certificates (for MITM HTTPS pages)

üß± Configuration
Edit config.json:
{
  "listen_host": "0.0.0.0",
  "listen_port": 8888,
  "allow_hosts": [],
  "block_hosts": [
    "facebook.com", ".facebook.com",
    "instagram.com", ".instagram.com",
    "tiktok.com", ".tiktok.com"
  ],
  "block_url_keywords": ["secret", "forbidden"],
  "default_policy": "allow",
  "admin_host": "127.0.0.1",
  "admin_port": 8890
}
Empty allow_hosts ‚Üí works in blocklist mode

Add hosts to block_hosts to block them

You can view live stats at http://127.0.0.1:8890/status

ü™µ Logs
All filtering decisions are stored in:

decisions.log
View live logs:

tail -f decisions.log
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
MITM decryption works only for blocked HTTPS hosts (to show HTML 403 page)

Do not use this proxy on real networks ‚Äî it‚Äôs for educational purposes only

Keep ca.key.pem private
